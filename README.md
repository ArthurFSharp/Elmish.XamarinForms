Never write a ViewModel class again!  Conquer the world with clean dynamic UIs!

This library uses a variation of [elmish](https://elmish.github.io/), an Elm architecture implemented in F#, to build Xamarin.Forms applications for iOS, Android, Mac and more. Elmish was originally written for [Fable](https://github.com/fable-compiler) applications, however it is used here for mobile applications using Xamarin.Forms. This is a sample and may change.

To quote [@dsyme](http://github.com/dsyme):

> In my work for Xamarin, I'm asking myself "what will appeal to F# devs who want to do Xamarin programming?". These devs are very code-oriented and know F#.  People are liking Elm and React via [Elmish](https://elmish.github.io/elmish/) and also React Native. Can we apply some of the lessons to Xamarin programming?

-----
This library is inspired by [Elmish.WPF](https://github.com/Prolucid/Elmish.WPF), [Elmish.Forms](https://github.com/dboris/elmish-forms) and [elmish](https://github.com/elmish/elmish), written by [et1975](https://github.com/et1975). This project technically has no tie to [Fable](http://fable.io/), which is an F# to JavaScript transpiler that is definitely worth checking out.
